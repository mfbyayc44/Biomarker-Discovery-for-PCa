# Biomarker-Discovery-for-PCa
This project utilizes machine-learning approaches in prostate cancer (PCa) biomarker discovery, including random forest and support vector machine.  

'multivariate.csv' and 'forest C vs C.csv' are proteomic data collected from PCa patients. The former documents are multavariante data with label 'Pre','Post','Active Surveillance','Control' and 'Non-cancer'. 

Sandbox - Cross Validation contains  data pre-processing, features selection, performing RF/SVM model, PCA and T-sne for binary data
